Constables typically have powers of arrest similar to, or sometimes less than, police officers.  The exact extent of their powers will depend on the laws of the specific state, province, or country where they operate.  Their authority is often limited to specific areas or types of offenses.  For example, some constables may primarily serve court documents and have limited arrest powers, while others might have more extensive powers, especially in rural areas.\n",

            "The fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution are enshrined in **Part III (Articles 12-35)**.  They are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Right to Equality (Articles 14-18):** This guarantees equality before the law, prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, and abolition of titles.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22):** This includes freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession or occupation.  However, these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law.  It also includes protection against arbitrary arrest and detention.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24):** This prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour, and also prohibits child labour.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25-28):** This guarantees freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.  It also ensures freedom to manage religious affairs and prohibits the state from establishing a religion.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29-30):** This protects the rights of minorities to conserve their distinct language, script, and culture.  It also gives minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32):** This is considered the heart and soul of fundamental rights.  It guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights.  This right is itself a fundamental right.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to note that these rights are not absolute and can be subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, health, etc.  The Supreme Court of India plays a crucial role in interpreting and protecting these fundamental rights.\n",

            "Whether rights can be suspended depends entirely on *which* rights you're referring to and *under what circumstances*.  There's no universal answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some rights, considered fundamental or inalienable, are generally understood to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to suspend completely, even in times of emergency.  Examples might include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **The right to life:** While capital punishment exists in some places, even that is a highly regulated and legally scrutinized process.  Mass, indiscriminate killing is universally condemned.\n",
            "* **The right to be free from torture:**  International human rights law prohibits torture under almost all circumstances.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other rights, however, may be subject to limitations or suspension under specific, carefully defined conditions, usually involving a compelling state interest and strict procedural safeguards.  These might include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Freedom of speech:**  This can be limited in cases involving incitement to violence, defamation, or revealing state secrets.\n",
            "* **Freedom of assembly:**  Large gatherings can be restricted during public health emergencies or to prevent violence.\n",
            "* **Right to privacy:**  Law enforcement may be able to obtain warrants for surveillance in specific circumstances.\n",
            "* **Right to due process:**  While the right to a fair trial is fundamental, certain aspects might be adjusted in wartime or under states of emergency (though this is highly controversial and requires strict legal justification).\n",
            "* **Right to travel:**  This can be restricted during pandemics or for reasons of national security.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The specific legal framework governing the suspension of rights varies significantly by country and jurisdiction.  International human rights law sets minimum standards, but the implementation and interpretation of these standards differ.  Often, there are judicial mechanisms for challenging the suspension of rights.\n",
